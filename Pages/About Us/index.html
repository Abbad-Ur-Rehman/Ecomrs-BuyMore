        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          It all started under the name of EDEN APPARELS – the effervescent
          company founded in 1988. Always fascinated by distinguished styles,
          the company bent its efforts to bringing colors, designs, fabrics &
          magic together. The initiative turned out to be a success and the
          company quickly became popular for its quality kids wear and later
          expanded its portfolio to rise as edenrobe – offering customers wide
          variety of finest ready-to-wear crafted to meet the ever changing
          demands of a modern family wardrobe.
